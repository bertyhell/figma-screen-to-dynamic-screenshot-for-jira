# Figma screen to dynamic screenshot for Jira

This chrome extension will convert the current page url in figma with a screen selected
into the thumbnail url for that screen (in markdown format).

So you can paste it into a jira ticket and the screenshot will always be up to date.

## Operation

* Install the extension
* Pin the extension, so it is always visible (optional)
  * 
* Right-click the extension button
  * 
* Set your [figma personal token](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens), so the extension can make calls to the Figma API
  * 
* Go to a figma file and click one of the screen titles.
* The url should look like: figma.com/file/<fileKey>/<title>?node-id=<nodeId>
* Click the extension button. You should see the notification that the copy was successful:
